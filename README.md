<h1>ASSIGNMENT 3:</h1>

<h3>Important NOTE:</h3>
<b>* Since this is a single web page, all the anchor elements are pointing to the same webpage.</b><br>
<b>* Since there is no server side component to this webpage, all the forms in the webpage are using the "GET" method instead of the "POST" method, since "POST" won't be     	   supported.</b><br><br>
